We just ask that you restrict\n% the number of 'columns' to three.\n%\n% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'\n% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors\n% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.\n% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.\n%\n% Use the \\alignauthor commands to handle the names\n% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.\n% Add names, affiliations, addresses for\n% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the\n% \\additionalauthors command.\n% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you\n% without further effort on your part as the last section in\n% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.\n\n\\numberofauthors{1} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*\n% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting\n% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \\additionalauthors section.\n\n\\author{\n% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,\n% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three\n% and a second row of one, two or three).\n%\n% The command \\alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should\n% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and\n% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of\n% affiliation/address with \\affaddr, and tag the\n% e-mail address with \\email.\n%\n% 1st. author\n\\alignauthor{Till Rohrmann\\\\\n       \\affaddr{Technical University of Berlin, Germany}\\\\\n       \\email{till.rohrmann@mailbox.tu-berlin.de}}\n}\n% There's nothing stopping you putting the seventh, eighth, etc.\n% author on the opening page (as the 'third row') but we ask,\n% for aesthetic reasons that you place these 'additional authors'\n% in the \\additional authors block, viz.\n\n\n\\date{\\today}\n% Just remember to make sure that the TOTAL number of authors\n% is the number that will appear on the first page PLUS the\n% number that will appear in the \\additionalauthors section.\n\n\n\\maketitle\n\n% ****************** TEXT **************************************\n\n% \\begin{abstract}\n% Abstract\n% \\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n With the begin of the information age, we have observed an unprecendented growth in computing, storage and telecommunications capacity.\n The technological progress on various fields such as semiconductors, algorithms and broadcasting spurred growth\n \n\\begin{itemize}\n	\\item Data analytics and web-scale data\n	\\item Parallel programming and challenges for users\n	\\item Parallel data flow systems (Stratosphere, Spark)\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Thesis Approach}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n	\\item Language design \\& parser\n	\\item Runtime\n	\\item Optimization of generated programs\n	\\item Evaluation of approach\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n	\\item Spark and Stratosphere\n	\\item Pegasus\n	\\item SystemML\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\n\n% \\section{Conclusions}\n%\\end{document}  % This is where a 'short' article might terminate\n\n%ACKNOWLEDGMENTS are optional\n% \\section{Acknowledgments}\n\n\n% The following two commands are all you need in the\n% initial runs of your .tex file to\n% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.\n\\bibliographystyle{abbrv}\n\\bibliography{references}  % references.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case\n% You must have a proper \".bib\" file\n%  and remember to run:\n% latex bibtex latex latex\n% to resolve all references\n\n\n\\end{document}\n",
