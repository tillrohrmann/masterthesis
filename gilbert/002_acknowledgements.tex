This thesis arose in the context of the master’s degree at the Database Systems and Information Management Group (DIMA) of the Technische Universität Berlin. 
I would like to express my deep and sincere gratitude to my adviser Dipl. Inf. Sebastian Schelter for his encouraging and personal guidance throughout this thesis. 
He was a steady source of thought-provoking impulses and provided me with untiring help, which led this thesis onto the right path. 
Moreover, I would like to thank him for reviewing my manuscript and giving me constructive criticism and excellent advice.

My earnest thanks goes as well to my supervisor Prof. Dr. Volker Markl for offering me the possibility to work on a fascinating topic and to gain insight into the current state of research on the field of scalable numerical data processing.
I also want to thank Prof. Dr. Odej Kao for taking the time to review and evaluate this thesis.
Moreover, I would like to thank the Database Systems and Information Management Group for providing me with the essential computational resources needed for the evaluation of Gilbert.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my family and friends for their continuous and sincere support during all these years.
