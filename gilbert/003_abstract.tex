In recent years, the generated and gathered data has increased at an almost exponential rate.
At the same time, people realized its usefulness in terms of insights it can bear.
However, lifting the true treasures requires powerful analysis tools, since they are buried deep below a pile of meaningless data.
Unfortunately, our analytic capacities did not scale well with the growing data.
Most of our existing tools run only on a single computer and thus are limited by its memory.
The most promising remedy to deal with large-scale data is to exploit parallelism.

We propose Gilbert, a distributed sparse linear algebra system, to solve the imminent lack of analytic capacities.
Gilbert offers a \matlab-like programming language for linear algebra programs, which are automatically executed in parallel.
The transparent parallelization is achieved by compiling the linear algebra operations into a suitable representation for the execution on massively parallel dataflow systems.
Prior to execution, different execution strategies are evaluated and the best one is chosen by a cost-based optimizer.
Gilbert uses Spark and Stratosphere, two parallel dataflow systems, to run linear algebra programs on a cluster of machines.
Distributed matrices are represented by square blocks to guarantee a well-balanced trade-off between data parallelism and data granularity.

Exhaustive evaluation proved that Gilbert is able to process varying amounts of data, exceeding the memory of a single computer, on clusters of different sizes.
Three famous machine learning (ML) algorithms, PageRank, k-means and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), were implemented with Gilbert.
That emphasizes Gilbert's support for distributed iterations, an essential prerequisite for a broad set of ML algorithms.
The performance of these algorithms is compared to optimized implementations based on Spark and Stratosphere.
Gilbert is not as fast as the optimized algorithms, but it compensates for that with a high-level programming language, simplifying the development process significantly.
