I intend to implement an intermediate representation of a Matlab program.
The additional abstraction layer allows language independent optimizations and makes the system independent from the actually used frontend language.
The set of language primitives of the intermediate representation has to include the operational primitives of linear algebra as well as an iteration abstraction in order to realize algorithms based on convergence.
Furthermore, it is of particular interest to keep this set as small as possible, because this would alleviate a possible optimization step prior to execution.
