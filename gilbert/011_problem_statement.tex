\chapter{Problem Statement}
\label{cha:problemstatement}

\chapterquote{Science never solves a problem without creating ten more.}{George Bernard Shaw, (1856 - 1950)}

\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the problem
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Need for analyzing tools capable of processing big data
		\item Cannot scale up vertically --> horizontally is the solution
		\item Most algorithms are based on linear algebra
		\item Data scientists familiar with R and Matlab
	\end{itemize}
	\item Why is it a problem
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Ever growing business
		\item People are looking for valuable business information
	\end{itemize}
	\item How will I solve the problem
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Define language representing linear algebra operations
		\item Build compiler infrastructure to compile Matlab code
		\item Map linear algebra operations to massively parallel dataflow systems
		\item Investigate and define parallel datastructures to represent matrices
		\item Look into optimizations to execute programs faster on runtime system
		\item Implement local operations with a library
		\item Emphasize research questions: Which language primitives do we have to support, how can the operations be realized within a distributed system?
	\end{itemize}
	\item Evaluating the solution
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Test scalability to prove applicability
		\item Implement ML algorithms with Gilbert
		\item Compare ML algorithms with specialized implementations (PageRank, K-Means, NNGF)
		\item Compare optimized with unoptimized algorithms
		\item Compare used math libraries
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
